## Highlights
- A force torque sensor detects the different forces that are applied on the robot wrist or tool in the 3 geometric axes (X-Y-Z). The sensor also detects the torque applied around the 3 different axes. Which basically means that the sensor feels what is going on in all axes. By doing so, the sensor gives feedback to the robot and can adapt its motion to feel the minimum of force that is applied to it. Once the sensor is feeling an acceptable amount of force torque, the robot can continue its motion without risk. Notice that some sensors can measure force on a specific axis for a specific application. Most force torque sensors are installed at the robot flange or wrist to measure the effort between the tool and the environment.
