A sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor.

## [[active sensor]]

## [[passive sensor]]

## electromechanical sensor

### [[piezoresistive sensor]]

### piezoelectric sensor

### electrostatic sensor

## measure of behaviors of sensors

### sensitivity

change in input required to generate a unit change in output

### measurement range

maximum and minimum value range over which a sensor works well.

### calibration

### response

#### response time

The time for a sensor to respond from no load to a step change in load. Usually specified as time to rise to *90%* of final value

#### recover time

The time for a sensor to return to baseline value after the step removal of the measured variable. Usually specified as time to fall to *10%* of final value after step removal of measured variable.

### stability

The degree to which sensor characteristics remain constant over time.

### repeatability

Ability of a sensor to repeat a measurement when put back in the same environment, or the response for different sensors.
