Gyroscope is used to measure or maintain orientation and [[angular velocity]]. A gyroscope resists rotation around any axis at right angles to its own axis of rotation or vibration.” ([Charles 等, 2016, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/NI73QRSC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PK7VQQLG?page=93&annotation=EV2RH854)) 
# structure
The structure of the gyroscope can be seen below:

The rotor will have a very quick rotational speed and the spin axis is fixed to the rotor. The outer part gimbal and gyroscope frame can freely rotate.
