#sensor 
It is the change in the electrical resistivity of a semiconductor or metal when mechanical strain is applied

## piezoresistive coefficient

measure of change of electrical resistivity with respect to strain
$\rho_{\sigma} = \frac{\frac{\partial \rho}{\rho}}{\epsilon}$
$\partial \rho =$ change in resistivity
$\rho$ original resistivity
$\epsilon$ strain

## material has this property

### semiconductor

#### advantages

1. more sensitive
2. higher temperature applications
