### thermistor

A type of resistor whose resistance is strongly dependent on temperature

#### negative temperature coefficient

Provides higher resistance at low temperatures

##### range

-55 degree to 200 degree

#### positive temperature coefficient

Provides higher resistance at higher temperatures.

##### range

60 degree to 120 degree

#### advantages

1. large resistance change with temperature
2. rapid response time
3. good stability
4. high resistance eliminates difficulties caused by lead resistance
5. low cost and interchangeable.

#### disadvantages

1. Non-linear
2. limited operating temperature range
3. may subject to inaccuracy due to overheating
4. current source required

### resistance temperature detector

#### structure

Consist of a film, or, for greater accuracy, a wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. Platinum makes up the most accurate RTDs while nickel and copper make RTDs that are lower cost.

#### range

-200 degree tp 600 degree for platinum
