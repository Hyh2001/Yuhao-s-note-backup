## electromagnetic induction effect

A process in which a conductor is put in a particular position and magnetic filed keeps varying or magnetic field is stationary and a conductor is moving. This produces a Voltage/Current across the electrical conductor.

### direction determination

### induction voltages

$\epsilon = -N\frac{\partial \phi_B}{\partial t}$

## characteristics of the sensor

1. large current and small voltage
