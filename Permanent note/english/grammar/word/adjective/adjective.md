Each is used in speaking of two or more things; every is used only in speaking of more than two. Each directs attention to the individuals forming any group, every to the total group. Each is used only when the number in the group is limited and definite ; every when the number is indefinite

### little, a little, the little

Little = not much, negative meaning
A little = some though not much
The little = not much, but all there is

### Few, a few, the few

Few = not many, hardly any, ‘Few’ has a negative meaning
A few = some. ‘A few’ has a positive meaning
The few = not many, but all there are
