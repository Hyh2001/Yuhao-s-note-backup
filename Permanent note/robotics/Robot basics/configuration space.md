#robotics/robot_motion 
It is defined as the $n$-dimensional space that contains all possible [[configuration]]s of the robot. For [[end-effector]]s, their configuration space is called [[task space]]. The dimension of configuration space equals to the [[degree of freedom]]. Despite dimensions, we can also consider the shape of a configuration space. We use the word [[topology]] to express the different shapes of surfaces. We can determine whether two surfaces are [[topologically equivalent]] or [[topologically distinct]].  Some configuration space can be expressed as the [[Cartesian product]] of two or more spaces of lower dimension. In order to perform calculations on configuration space, we need to numerically represent them. There are two types of methods.

# numerical representation of configuration space
## 1. [[explicit parametrization]]
## 2. [[implicit representation]] 
method 2 is preferred.
