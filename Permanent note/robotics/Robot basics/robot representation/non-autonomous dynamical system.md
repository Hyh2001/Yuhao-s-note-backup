These dynamical systems can  be modeled as $\dot{x(t)} = f(x(t),t)$ where the $t$ captures all the non-$x$ dependent variables. 
# solution 
For a nonlinear ODE 

$\dot{x(t)} = f(x(t),t)$ with $x(t_0) = x_0$  

Then is has a unique solution if $f(x,t)$ is [[Lipschitz]] in $x$ and [[piecewise continuous]] in $t$ 
# proof 
## with A a constant
By given 



There are several subtypes of non-autonomous dynamical system. 
# 1. [[control system]]
