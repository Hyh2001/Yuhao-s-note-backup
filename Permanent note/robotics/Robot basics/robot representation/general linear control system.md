A general linear control system is a subtype of [[control system]] and it can be modeled by the equation below. 
$\begin{matrix} \dot{x(t)} = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\ y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \end{matrix}$ with $x(0) = x_0$ and $y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$ is called a static relation
$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$: system state,
$u \in \mathbb{R}^m$: control input
$y \in \mathbb{R}^p$: system output
$A,B,C,D$ are constant matrices with appropriate dimensions.
