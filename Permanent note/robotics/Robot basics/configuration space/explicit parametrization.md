A choice of $n$ coordinates, or parameters to represent an $n$-dimensional space.
The representation of a space involves a choice of reference frame. In this representation, sometimes singularities (see [[singularity]]) will come into being. We have ways to deal with them
### 1.
We can use more than one [[coordinate chart]] on the space, where each coordinate chart is an explicit parametrization covering only a portion of the space. These charts will overlap with each other and cover the entire space. The charts will form an [[atlas]] of the space.

### advantages of the method
1. representation always use the minimum number of numbers.
### disadvantages of the method
1. extra bookkeeping required to switch representations between coordinate charts.
