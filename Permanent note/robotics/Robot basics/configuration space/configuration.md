#robotics/robot_motion 
It is a complete specification of the positions of all points of the robot. It can be represented by several numbers. The smallest number of numbers needed is called [[degree of freedom]].

1. configuration of a point: it is fully described by a [[position]]
2. configuration of a body: it is fully described by a position and a [[rotation]] to describe its [[pose]].  


# representation of configuration
we represent the configuration of a rigid body by attaching a [[reference frame]]  to some point on the rigid body and keeping track of the motion of this body coordinate frame relative to a fixed frame.  

By observations, arbitrary motions can be represented by screw motions and based on this inspection, we can have [[exponential coordinate]] of a rigid body.
