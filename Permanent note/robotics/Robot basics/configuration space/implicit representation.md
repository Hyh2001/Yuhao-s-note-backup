We can use implicit representation which views the $n$-dimensional space as embedded in a Euclidean space of more than $n$ dimensions. It uses the coordinates of the higher-dimensional space. We will use [[rotation matrix]]  to represent orientation of objects. ([[unit quaternion]] is another method.)

### advantages

1. no singularities will show in the representation.
2. For [[closed-chain mechanism]]s, it may be hard to construct [[explicit parametrization]] but it is easy to find an implicit representation of  the set of all joint coordinates subject to the [[loop-closure equation]]s that define the closed loops.

### disadvantages

1. the representation has more numbers than the number of [[degree of freedom]].
