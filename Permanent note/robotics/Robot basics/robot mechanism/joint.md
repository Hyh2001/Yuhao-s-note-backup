#robotics 
The mechanical parts to joint several [[link]]s together. There may be some [[sensor]]s at the joints to measure force, torque, displacement and speed. Cameras are also introduced for measuring color and depth.

# understanding of joints:

There are two ways to view a joint and they are as below:

1. View a joint as providing freedoms to allow one rigid body to move relative to another rigid body
2. View a joint as a constraint on motion of two rigid bodies it connects

# joints in Robot

There are several types of joints that can be commonly found in robots and they are as follow:

## with one degree of freedom

### [[revolute joint]]

### [[prismatic joint]]

### [[helical joint]]

## with multiple degree of freedom

### [[cylindrical joint]]

### [[universal joint]]

### [[spherical joint]]
