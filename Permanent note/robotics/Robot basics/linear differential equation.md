A linear differential equation is defined by the linear polynomial equation, which consists of derivatives of several variables. In general,$n$-th order differential equations are in the form of: 
$a_0(x) y + a_1(x)y^{'} + a_2(x) y^{''} + ... + a_n(x) y^{n} = b(x)$  
where $a_0(x), a_1(x), ... a_n(x)$ are arbitrary [[differentiable function]]s without needing to be linear.

## general dynamical system
For linear differential equations with the form $\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t))$, we call them [[general dynamical system]]
