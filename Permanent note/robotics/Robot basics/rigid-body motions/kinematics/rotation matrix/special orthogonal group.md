It is just the same to the **[[rotation matrix]]**.  It is the set of all $3 \times 3$ real [[matrix]] $R$ satisfying the properties listed below. It can be denoted as $SO(3)$. [[matrix logarithm]] and [[matrix multiplication]] forms a [[group]]. Also, for two dimensions, the special orthogonal group becomes $SO(2)$ which is the set of all $2 \times 2$ real Matrix $R$ and it is a [[subgroup]] of $SO(3)$.

# properties

1. $R^{T}R=I$ or $det R = 1$
	This two property is interchangeable for $det (R) = det(R^T)$ and $det (RR^{T})=det(R)det(R^T)$ 
2. properties as a group
