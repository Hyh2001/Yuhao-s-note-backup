Forward kinematics computes the [[end-effector]] motion in terms of the given magnitudes of the [[joint]] s.  ([Pardos-Gotor, 2021, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/V6J2RZZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9ZMQK9KL?page=60&annotation=MSSGHUGF))
Forward kinematics always has a solution which is unique which means that it is easier than [[inverse kinematics]] problems.  ([Pardos-Gotor, 2021, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/V6J2RZZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9ZMQK9KL?page=60&annotation=NKFB9N5G))

There are two methods for us to choose between: 
1. [[Denavit-Hartenberg convention]] 
2. [[product of exponential]]
