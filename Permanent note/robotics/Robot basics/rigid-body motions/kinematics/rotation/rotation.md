Rotation is a circular movement of an object around a [[rotation axis]], the degree to which it has rotated is denoted by [[angular coordinate]]. 
The denotation of rotation requires a [[reference frame]] $A$ and a [[body frame]] $B$ and it is denoted as $\phi_{AB}$ which means that it is the rotation of frame $B$ versus frame $A$.
