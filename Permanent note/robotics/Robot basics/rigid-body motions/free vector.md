A free vector is a geometric quantity with a length and a direction. It is denoted as "v"  Think of it as an arrow in $R^n$. It is called “free” because it is not necessarily rooted anywhere. If we choose a [[reference frame]] for it, the base of the arrow will be the origin of the frame. Then the free vector "v" can be represented by its coordinate in the reference frame as $v$. "v" is coordinate free and $v$ is coordinate dependent.

# usage
