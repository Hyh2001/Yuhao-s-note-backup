ROS use loggers to convey the status of a node. We can use [[Rqt_logger_level]] to change the verbosity level of a node. There are 8 types and 5 levels of loggings. The five levels are [[ROS_DEBUG]], [[ROS_INFO]], [[ROS_WARN]], [[ROS_ERROR]], [[ROS_FATAL]]. For different levels, there will be different colors of words. 

#todo ==what is the color for each of them==?
