#ros 

Roslaunch command is used to run a [[ROS launch file]], along with that we have to mention package name and name of the launch file. 
# why we need roslaunch 
It is because that sometimes we want to launch many [[ROS node]]s at the same time and [[rosrun]] will not fulfill our need. 

# use of roslaunch
```shell
	roslauch ros_pkg_name launch_file_name
```
