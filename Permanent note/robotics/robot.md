A robot is a [[mechanism]], it has some specific structures for performing works. When working on robots, the first thing we want to know of them is: where is the robot? We use [[configuration]] to answer this problem. Each configuration can be represented by $n$ numbers. The smallest number of $n$ numbers is [[degree of freedom]]. For the numbers that are given other than the $n$ numbers, we say that they are [[redundant]] constraints.  For all the robots, they can have different configurations which contain $n$ numbers for each, and all the configurations combined represented  [[configuration space]]. Therefore, we are interested in how to represent a configuration space. (details see configuration space). More than configuration space there are two spaces that are relevant to the [[end-effector]] of robots called [[task space]] and [[workspace]].
