Terrain classification aims at associating terrains with one of a few predefined, commonly known categories, such as gravel, sand, or asphalt. ([Ojeda 等, 2006, p. 103](zotero://select/library/items/TALD76XT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EG67QMF3?page=1&annotation=UCHYKDWQ))

In the field of terrain classification, different sensors and different classifiers are used. However, the basic working flow of terrain classification is quite fixed. Feature extraction algorithms will be performed on data acquired by sensors and then the results will be treated as the input of data-driven classifiers. This workflow can be both applied to wheeled robots and legged robots with slightly different approaches. ([Dallaire 等, 2015, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/ZK42NYZF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2XAV3337?page=1&annotation=8JAB5F86)) 

The sensors used for terrain classification can be categorized into several types: [[acoustic sensor]], [[tactile sensor]], [[camera]], [[vibration sensor]] (more precisely [[accelerometer]] )
