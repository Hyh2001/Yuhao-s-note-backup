A version control system, or VCS, tracks **the history of changes** as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be **recovered** at any time.
VCSs give each contributor a **unified and consistent** view of a project. 

There are two types of version control systems: 
1. [[distributed version control system]] 
2. [[centralized version control system]]
