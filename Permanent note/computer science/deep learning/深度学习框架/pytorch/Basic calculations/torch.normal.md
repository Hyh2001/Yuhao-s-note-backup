Returns a tensor of random numbers drawn from separate [[normal distribution]] whose [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] are given.

```python 
torch.normal(mean,std,size)
# mean is the mean of the normal distribution 
# std is the standard deviation of the normal distribution
# size is the output tensor size 
```
