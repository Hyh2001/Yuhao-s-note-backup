It is the [[differentiation]] made by computers automatically. Its working mechanism is as bellowï¼š 

As we pass data through each successive function, the framework builds a [[computational graph]] that tracks how each value depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation works backwards through this graph applying the chain rule The computational algorithm for applying the [[chain rule]] in this fashion is called [[backpropagation]].
