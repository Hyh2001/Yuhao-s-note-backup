specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the [[density]] of a substance to the density of some standard substance at a specified temperature (usually water at $4\degree C$, for which $\rho_{H_{2O} =}1000 kg/m^3$)” ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=41&annotation=9RVKJNSM))
$SG = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{H_2O}}$
