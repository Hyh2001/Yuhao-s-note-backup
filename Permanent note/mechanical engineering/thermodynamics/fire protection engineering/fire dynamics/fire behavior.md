# fire

A rapid chemical oxidation process that results in the evolution of heat and light in varying intensities

## fuel

Any material that can be burned to release thermal energy

### prerequisite to burn

1. Must be brought above its ignition temperature
2. Proportions of the fuel and air must be in the proper range for combustion to begin
## flashover

The transition phase in the development of a contained fire in which surfaces exposed to the thermal radiation, from fire glass in excess of 600 degree, reach ignition temperature more or less simultaneously and fire spreads rapidly through the space

## main types of fire

### flash over

#### rollover

The ignition of the gas layer under the ceiling, leading to total involvement of the compartment. The fuel/air ratio is at the bottom region of the flammability range

#### backdraft

When the flammable gases are ignited while at the upper region of the falmmability range.

### smoldering

A relatively slo combustion process that occurs between oxygen in the air and a solid fuel

### spontaneous combustion

A combustion process that can begin with a slow oxidation in a fuel exposed air.
