Atmospheric air is the combination of [[dry air]] and [[water vapor]]. It is a [[mixture]] ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 753](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=753&annotation=X53VFELN)) There are also a certain types of atmospheric air called [[saturated air]]. We use the properties listed below to portrait the relationship between dry air and water vapor 
1. [[specific humidity]]
2. [[relative humidity]] 

In certain conditions, both water vapor and dry air can be treated as [[ideal gas]] and we can apply method listed in [[mixture - ideal gas]] to analyze it. 


# enthalpy 
[[enthalpy]]  of atmospheric air is the sum of the enthalpies of dry air and the water vapor divided by mass of the dry air. ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 755](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=755&annotation=ZVQJHXPK))
$H = H_{a}+H_{v}=m_{a}h_{a}=m_{v}h_{v}$ 
$h =\frac{H}{m_a}=h_{a}+\omega h_{g}$
