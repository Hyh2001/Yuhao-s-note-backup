An ideal gas is defined as a gas whose molecules are spaced far apart so that the behavior of a molecule is not influenced by the presence of other molecules—a situation encountered at low densities. ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 717](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=717&annotation=E8BWHMFQ))
Real gases approximate this behavior closely when they are at a low pressure or high temperature relative to their critical-point values. ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 717](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=717&annotation=9LE3DJCW))
Ideal gas can be governed by the [[ideal-gas equation of state]]
