The dew-point temperature $T_{dp}$ is defined as the temperature at which condensation begins when the air is cooled at constant pressure. ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 757](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=757&annotation=V2DV76NP))
It is the same to the [[saturation temperature]] of water corresponding to the [[water vapor]] pressure. 
$T_{dp}=T_{sat}$
