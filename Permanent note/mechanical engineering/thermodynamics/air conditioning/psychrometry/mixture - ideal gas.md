A nonreacting mixture of [[ideal gas]] also behaves as an ideal gas. ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 717](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=717&annotation=H5J22LY9))

We can calculate the [[mole fraction]] of each component by $Y_{i}=\frac{n_i}{n}$ where $n_i$ is the mole number of component $i$ and $n$ is the total number of [[mole]] s. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5QB2YK6?page=3&annotation=ZIWPLZXM)) To evaluate properties of mixtures, we can use the property table for [[pure substance]] and using the equation below:  $U_{mix} = n_{A}U_{A}+n_{B}U_{B}$ where $n$ is the mole number.  ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5QB2YK6?page=4&annotation=ZURST54U))

We have two laws to portrait the behavior of mixtures of ideal gases: 
1. [[Dalton's law]]
2. [[Amagat's law]]

For an ideal- gas mixture, the [[mole fraction]] , the pressure fraction (see [[Dalton's law]] ), and the volume fraction (see [[Amagat's law]] ) of a component are identical ([Çengel 和 Boles, 2015, p. 718](zotero://select/library/items/FCMSUVW2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DFP6L6PZ?page=718&annotation=JUREURWS))
