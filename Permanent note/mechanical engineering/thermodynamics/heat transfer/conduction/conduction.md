Conduction is the heat transfer through [[solid]]  material. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BLQM2C86?page=18&annotation=DD64RWL4))
It is governed by the equation: 
$q = KA\frac{\delta t}{L}$ and its [[differential]] form as $q=-KA\frac{dt}{dx}$. we denote $\frac{K}{L}$ as conductance. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BLQM2C86?page=19&annotation=SAEGH8W2))
