Torque is defined as the  **[[cross product]] of a [[force]] $F$ and its [[position vector]] $r$ with respect to a point $O$**. $\vec{M_{0}}= \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$ ([“Vector mechanics for engineers. Statics and dynamics”, 2013, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/88QX3VHX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X8RTBG22?page=118&annotation=5XSRSTMJ)) 
It is developed when **the external loads tend to twist one segment of the body with respect to the other** about an axis perpendicular to the area. ([Hibbeler, 2011, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/XW832UJH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5Q89FKQF?page=27&annotation=7IHL82BL))

Because torque obeys the properties of cross product, we can easily find its properties as follow: 
1. $\vec{M_{0}}$ is [[perpendicular]] to the plane containing $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$. 
2. It obeys **[[right-hand rule]]**
3. $\vec{M_{0}}= \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = rFsin\theta =Fd$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$ and $d$ represents the perpendicular distance from $O$ to the line of action of $\vec{F}$ ([“Vector mechanics for engineers. Statics and dynamics”, 2013, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/88QX3VHX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X8RTBG22?page=118&annotation=BVJ2M6YX))
4. [[Varignon's theorem ]]

# physical interpretation 
The magnitude of $M_0$ measures **the tendency of the force $F$  to make the [[rigid body]] rotate about a fixed axis directed along $M_0$** ([“Vector mechanics for engineers. Statics and dynamics”, 2013, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/88QX3VHX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X8RTBG22?page=118&annotation=DY7V4MAN))
