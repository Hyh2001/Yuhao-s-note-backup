From the picture below, we can see that the position both of $P$ and of the entire body is completely defined by the angle **$\theta$ that the line $BP$ forms with the $zx$ plane**. And we defined this angle as *angular coordinate* of the body. We define that it is positive when viewed as **counterclockwise** form $A^{'}$. The unit of this coordinate is **rad**, which  
$1$ rev = $2\pi$ rad = $360\degree$
