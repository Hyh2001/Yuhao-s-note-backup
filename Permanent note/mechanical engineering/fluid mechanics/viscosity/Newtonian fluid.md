Fluids for which the rate of deformation is linearly proportional to the shear stress are called Newtonian fluids. ([“fluid mechanics fundamentals and applications”, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/TWA5RBHQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8J59SQQB?page=79&annotation=Z5TNWTQT))
Newtonian fluid follows the [[Newton's law of viscosity]]
