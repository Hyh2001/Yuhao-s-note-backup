The [[surface force]] that develop at the [[support]] s or points of contact between bodies are called reactions ([Hibbeler, 2011, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/XW832UJH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5Q89FKQF?page=24&annotation=HRJLRLDJ))

# direction of reactions 
If the support prevents translation in a given direction, then a force must be developed on the member in that direction. Likewise, if rotation is prevented, a couple moment must be exerted on the member.
