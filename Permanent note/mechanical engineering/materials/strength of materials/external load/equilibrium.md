Equilibrium of a body requires both a balance of [[force]] s, to prevent the body from translating or having accelerated motion along a straight or curved path, and a balance of [[moment]] s ([Hibbeler, 2011, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/XW832UJH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5Q89FKQF?page=25&annotation=FU8BH7Q7))
We use two equations to denote it: 
$\sum F =0$
$\sum M_o=0$ ($o$ is any point that inside or outside the body but  is most often chosen at the centroid of the sectioned area ([Hibbeler, 2011, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/XW832UJH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5Q89FKQF?page=26&annotation=6M4NEB3F)))

With coordinate axis, we can decompose them into six equations: 
$\sum F_{x}=0$
$\sum F_{y}=0$
$\sum F_{z}=0$
$\sum M_x=0$
$\sum M_y=0$
$\sum M_z=0$
