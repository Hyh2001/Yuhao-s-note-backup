Polymer is a macromolecule (large molecule) built up by **repetitive bonding of small molecules ([[monomer]])**. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MVG2VJW?page=19&annotation=LWY2ETES)) We can denote then as:

Inside monomers: $C - H$ bond is called [[hydrocarbon]] s. 
Between monomers: $n$ is the number of **[[monomer]]** . Increasing $n$ will change the material from **liquid to solid**. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MVG2VJW?page=24&annotation=Y49L2VV6))

# functional group
Different [[functional group]]s have been attached to polymers. 
## dissolvability 
The dissolvability of a polymer depends on the ratio of [[hydrophilic]] functional groups. ([“EMEN 3032 Special topics in Electromechanical Engineering III”, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/3UBF9LWL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJLPFJ7H?page=14&annotation=EVNWKCMH))

# Polymer chains
## polymer chains length 
We can define chain end-to-end distance $r$ which is much smaller than the total chain length due to entanglement.  ([“EMEN 3032 Special topics in Electromechanical Engineering III”, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/3UBF9LWL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJLPFJ7H?page=12&annotation=BHWMIM3C))“
## entanglement
Due to the increase on lengths of polymers, they tend to create coils and entanglements. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MVG2VJW?page=26&annotation=PXHF7UNE))
