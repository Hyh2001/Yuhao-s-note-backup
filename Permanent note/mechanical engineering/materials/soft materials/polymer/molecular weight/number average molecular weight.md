It is the average molecular weight calculated from the number fraction distribution of molecules in a sample. 
The calculation equation is::
$\bar{M_{n}}= \sum x_{i}M_i$
where 
1. $x_{i}$ is the number fraction of chains in size range $i$  :: $x_{i}=  \frac{number\ of\ molecules}{total\ number\ of\ molecules}$   
2. $M_i$ is the **mean molecular weight** of chains size range $i$   $M_{i}= \frac{\sum_{a=0}^{n}M_a}{n}$
