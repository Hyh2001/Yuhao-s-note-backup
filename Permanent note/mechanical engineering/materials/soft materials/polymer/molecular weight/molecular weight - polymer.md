Polymer molecular weight is defined as a distribution rather than a specific number because of the random nature of polymerization reactions.
There are two ways for we to define this distribution. 
1. [[number average molecular weight]]
2. [[weight average molecular weight]] 
The two weights are related [[number average molecular weight - weight average molecular weight]]
Based on this two weights, we can define [[polydispersity index]]
