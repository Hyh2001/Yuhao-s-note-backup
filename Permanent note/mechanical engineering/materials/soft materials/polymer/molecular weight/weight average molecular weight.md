It Is the average molecular weight calculated from the weight fraction distribution of molecules in a sample. The equation is $\bar{M_{w}}= \sum{w_i}{M_i}$ 
where 
1. $w_{i}$ is the weight fraction of chains in size range $i$ $w_{i}= \frac{N_iM_i}{W}$  where $N_i$ is the number of **specific molecules**, $M_i$ is molecular weight of chains. $W$ is the total weight of all the molecules.  
2. $M_i$ is the mean molecular weight of chain in size range $i$ $M_{i}= \frac{\sum_{a=0}^{n}M_a}{n}$
