This index is defined as the fraction of [[weight average molecular weight]] and [[number average molecular weight]] which is denoted by $PDI = \frac{\bar{M_{w}}}{\bar{M_n}}$

The real world meaning of this index is that it tells us that how far the polymer departs from monodisperse (how far $\bar{M_w}$ is away from $\bar{M_n}$) : 
1. PDI is very high, chain lengths vary a lot
2. PDI is very low, chain lengths are around the same size
