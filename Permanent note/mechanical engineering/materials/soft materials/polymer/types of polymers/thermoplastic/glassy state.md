At the glassy state, the [[polymer]] is relatively [[brittle]].  ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZTFTC588?page=11&annotation=SNK38EDS))
Inside glassy state, there are also differences between different temperatures: ($T_{g}$ is the [[glass transition temperature]] ) 
1. $T < 0.8T_{g}$, bonds between molecules are strong, the chains cannot slide and it is totally brittle. 
2. $T\simeq 0.8T_{g}$ the materials starts to have limited ductility and molecules have some mobility with no [[strain hardening]]. 
3. $T = T_{g}$ The material is similar to high [[viscosity]] flow.
