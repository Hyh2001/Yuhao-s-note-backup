Thermoplastics are a class of **non-chemically crosslinked** long chain polymers that **can be softened** through heating. Shape of chains are linear or branched.

With no cross links, its [[intermolecular force]] between chains are **weak** which means that when heating the weak forces will break which will induce **reshape**.

# States of thermoplastics 
Thermoplastics can be [[amorphous]] or [[semi-crystalline]]. 
1. [[amorphous thermal transition]]
2. [[semi-crystalline thermal transition]] 
# Fabrication of thermoplastics 
## injection moulding 
Thermoplastic polymer is **heated above** its melting temperature. The melted solution is injected into a mold which has the desired shape of the final object, followed by **cooling**.

# recyclability 
Some of thermoplastics can be recycled but some are not ([“EMEN 3032 Special topics in Electromechanical Engineering III Lecture 3”, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/8J65FRWW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8A7PQIJG?page=19&annotation=RMFEC693))
