Ionic crosslinking crosslinks via interaction between oppositely charged [[compound]]s. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=4&annotation=W2GXKGQS))
Ionic crosslinking is constructed by two types of [[ionic bond]]: 
1. metal ions and negatively charged hydrogels. 
2. electrostatic interaction: interactions between negatively charged hydrogels, polyelectrolyte complexes. [[what is polyelectrolyte complexes]]? ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKFCBTUB?page=22&annotation=BCQ4956A))
