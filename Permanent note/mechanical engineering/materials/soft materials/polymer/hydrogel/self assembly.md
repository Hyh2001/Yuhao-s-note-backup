Self-assembled hydrogels are formed by spontaneous assembly of polymeric chains into compact configurations via physical interaction induced by external stimuli.
The interactions include: 
[[hydrophobic interaction]] , [[hydrogen bond]], [[Van der Waals force]] 
The external stimuli includes: 
Thermal, pH
