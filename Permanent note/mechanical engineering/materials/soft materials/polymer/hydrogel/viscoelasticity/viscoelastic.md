Viscoelasticity is the property of a material that exhibit both [[viscosity]] and [[elastic]] characteristics ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=11&annotation=7PGSBW33))
The materials will exhibit time-dependent [[stress]] / [[strain]] characteristics. 
1. [[creep]]
2. [[stress relaxation]]
# principle 
Viscoelastic behaviors occur because of the types of deformations vary. When deformation is small, it is elastic deformation. When deformation is large, it is plastic deformation.

# Modelling 
We use a combination of spring and dashpots to model this phenomenon. There are two methods: ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PXFCS2FM?page=12&annotation=RTNUNSLW))
1. [[Maxwell model]]
2. [[Voigt model]]
