This model represents a parallel connection of a spring and a  dashpot elements.  ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PXFCS2FM?page=14&annotation=3XW2ZK22))

# properties 
1. The [[stress]] are distributed: $\sigma=\sigma_s+\sigma_{d}$ 
2. The [[strain]] are equal: $\epsilon=\epsilon_{s}=\epsilon_{d}$ 
We can have the equality: $\sigma=E\epsilon+\mu\dot{\epsilon}$  
## for [[stress relaxation]]
The [[strain rate]] is $\dot{\epsilon}=0$ which gives 
$\sigma=E\epsilon_{0}$ 
## for [[creep]] 
The stress rate is constant 




# drawbacks 
1. cannot predict stress relaxation 
* [ ] Why?
