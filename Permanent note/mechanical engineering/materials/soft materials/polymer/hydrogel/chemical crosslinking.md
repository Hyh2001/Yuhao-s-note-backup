Chemical crosslinking is the formation of a bond between polymer chains through chemical [[covalent bond]].  ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKFCBTUB?page=29&annotation=7WVANAEV))
It has several properties: 
1. not reversible 
2. toxic reagent required 
3. poor biocompatibility
4. difficult preparation 
([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=8&annotation=759GEID6))

There are three types of them: 
1. wet-chemical crosslinking 
2. enzymatic crosslinking 
3. photopolymerization
