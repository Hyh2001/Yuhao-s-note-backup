Hydrogel is defined as a **three-dimensional** network of **[[hydrophilic]] [[polymer]]**  that are crosslinked **physically or chemically** and hold a large amount of **water**. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKFCBTUB?page=3&annotation=FJP29C8J))
# functional groups
1. [[amino group]]
2. [[carboxyl group]] 
3. [[hydroxyl group]]
All of the [[functional group]] s can build **[[hydrogen bond]]** with water. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKFCBTUB?page=5&annotation=3HELUKCD))
# states of water 
The water inside hydrogel has three states: 
1. bound water: this type of water has **strong interaction** with polymer and they are not freezable 
2. intermediate water: this type of water has moderate interaction with polymer chain and they are **freezable below $0 \degree C$**
3. Free water: Not interact with the network structure, freezable **at $0 \degree C$**
([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKFCBTUB?page=6&annotation=JN7AJLVA))

# classification of hydrogel 
## sources 
### Natural hydrogel 
There are two types of natural hydrogels: **[[protein]]** and **[[polysaccharide]]**
1. poor control over chemical structure 
2. poor flexibility 
3. good biocompatibility 
4. biodegradable 
5. poor long-term stability 
### synthetic hydrogel 
1. better control over chemical structure 
2. better flexibility 
3. poor biocompatibility 
4. not biodegradable 
5. better long-term stability 
## charges 
### anionic 
With [[carboxyl group]], the hydrogel will be **negatively charged**. 
because: 
$\ce{R - COOH + H_{2}O <--> R-COO^{-}+ H_3O^+}$ 
The functional group is negatively charged. 
### cationic 
With [[amino group]], the hydrogel will be **positively charged**. 
because: 
$\ce{R - NH_2 + H^+ <--> R-NH_3^+}$
The functional group is positively charged. 
### non-ionic 
With [[hydroxyl group]], the functional group will not be charged. 
## crosslinking
Crosslinking will 
1. enhance **[[viscosity]]** of hydrogels
2. making hydrogels turning into **manipulable hydrogels** with shape 
### [[physical crosslinking ]]
### [[chemical crosslinking ]]
## configuration 
1. [[amorphous]]
2. [[semi-crystalline]]

# properties of hydrogels 
## [[viscoelastic]]
## wetness 
Hydrogels can contain more than $90 \%$ of water which is similar to human tissues. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=12&annotation=DX539M7F))
## [[Young's modulus]]
Hydrogels have similar youngâ€™s modulus but poorer [[toughness]] comparing with human tissues ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=13&annotation=K2RVPI2P))
## stimuli-responsive 
Hydrogels can change their shapes in response to external stimuli like pH, temperature, electrical field, light etc. Their response can be swell, shrink, bend or degrade ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=15&annotation=RN5IPTFH))
### pH responsive 
Swell or shrink in response to pH changes and small change in pH can cause a significant changes to mesh size ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=17&annotation=VX5HSR89))
#### with carboxyl groups 
Hydrogels with carboxyl groups will swell with **increasing pH** ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=17&annotation=9UR7GXSU))
The principles is that with increasing pH, [[deprotonation]] occurs which causes higher ionic strength and finally the hydrogel swells. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=18&annotation=E2W3DXFS))
#### with amino groups
Hydrogels with amino groups will swell with **decreasing pH** ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=17&annotation=3DSB7S5U))
The principles is that with decreasing pH, [[protonation]] occurs which causes higher ionic strength and finally the hydrogel swells. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=19&annotation=L3BLCRQK))

### electric field responsive 
This responsive happens in [[electrolyte]] solutions. The shape change factors like bending speed and deflection depends on the applied voltage, crosslinking density and the ionic functional group density. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=22&annotation=BTUFB6R5))
#### for anionic hydrogel 
[[anionic hydrogel]] s bend toward [[cathode]] under electric field 
The principle is that the positively charged ions inside the diffusion will diffuse through the gel toward the negatively charged cathode. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=26&annotation=IAM3QPCD)) The anions will concentrate on the surface of the gel facing the cathode. Then water will diffuse toward the cathode to reduce the [[osmotic pressure]] then the gel facing the anode swells more. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=26&annotation=JQYAPGH6))
#### for cationic hydrogel 
[[cationic hydrogel]] s bend toward [[anode]] under electric field 
The principle is that the negatively charged ions inside the diffusion will diffuse through the gel toward the positively charged cathode. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=26&annotation=IAM3QPCD))
The cations will concentrate on the surface of the gel facing the anode. Then water will diffuse toward the anode to reduce the osmotic pressure then the gel facing the cathode swells more. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=26&annotation=JQYAPGH6))
### thermal responsive 
1. [[lower critical solution temperature]] hydrogels shrink by heating 
2. [[upper critical solution temperature]] hydrogels shrink by cooling 
### light responsive 
Special light responsive functional groups are located on the polymer backbone and they change their chemical/physical properties when stimulated by lights.   ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XFXYA2G?page=29&annotation=XQB66GY2))
### magnetic field responsive
