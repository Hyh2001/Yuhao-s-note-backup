A binary relation $R$ consists of a set $A$, called the [[domain]] of $R$, a set $B$ called the [[codomain]] of $R$, and a subset of $A \times B$ called the *graph* of $R$. (when A = B, say the relation is “on A.”)

## special binary relations

### [[function]]

when it has the  $\leq 1$ arrow out(every point in the domain column has at most one arrow coming out of it) property.

### surjective

when it has the  $\geq 1$ arrow in property. That is, every point in the right-hand, codomain column has at least one arrow pointing to it.

### total

when it has the  $\geq 1$ arrow out property

### injective

when it has the $\leq 1$ arrow in property

### bijective

when it has both the $= 1$ arrow out and the $= 1$ arrow in property

## relational images

The image of a set $Y$ under a relation $R$ written $R(Y)$, is the set of elements of the codomain $B$ of $R$ that are related to some element in $Y$

### inverse relations and image

#### inverse

$R^{-1}$ of a relation $R: A \to B$ is the relation from $B$ to $A$
$b$ $R^{-1}$ $a$  IFF $a$ $R$ $b$

#### inverse image

inverse image of a set $X \subseteq B$ under the relation $R$ is defined to be $R$
