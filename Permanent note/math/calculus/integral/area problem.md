# area problem

​#calculus/integral#​

The *area* $A$ of the region $S$ that lies under the graph of the continuous function $f$ is the limit of the sum of the areas of approximating rectangles:
$A = lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = lim_{n \to \infty}[f(x_1) \delta x + f(x_2) \delta x + ... + f(x_n) \delta x]$

## area bounded by two curves

The area $A$ of the region bounded by the curves $y=f(x),y=g(x)$, and the lines $x=a,x=b$,where $f$ and $g$ are [[continuous on an interval]] and $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, is  
​$A = \int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]dx$  
The area bounded between two curves is as follow.  
​$A = \int_a^b|f(x)-g(x)|dx$  
note that this formula do not care about which curve is at the top
