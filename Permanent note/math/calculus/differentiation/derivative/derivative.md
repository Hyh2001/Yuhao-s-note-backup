# difference quotient
For $y = f(x)$ , $x,y \in R$
$f^{'}(x) =d   y/d x =lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{(f(x+\delta x)-f(x))} {\delta x}$ is called the derivative of $f(x)$ versus $x$ 

## Geometric meanings:
1. The slope of the secant line through two points $x$ and $x + \delta x$ and $\delta x \to 0$.  ([[derivative - shape of a graph]] )
2. Rate of change. 

## tangent line to a point

$y - y_0 = f^{â€™}(x_0)(x-x_0)$

## when derivative exists or not exists
