#calculus/differentiation 
If the derivate of $f$ exists at $x$ , we can say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$. If the [[derivative]] of $f$ is not defined at $x$, then we say $f$ is not differentiable at $x$  

## [[differentiable function]]


## differentiable and [[continuity]]

If f is differentiable at $x_0$, then f is continuous at $x_0$

### proof:

we need to show $lim_{x \to x_0}f(x)-f(x_0) = 0$ (continuous)
this equals to $lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}(x -x_0) = f^{'}(x) \cdot (x-x_0)$  (differentiable)
