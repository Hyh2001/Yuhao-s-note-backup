Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable and $g^{'}(x) \neq 0$ on an open interval $I$ that contains $a$(except possibly at $a$). Suppose that
we have indeterminate form of type $\frac{0}{0}$ or type $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, then
$lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = lim_{x \to a}\frac{f^{'}(x)}{g^{'}(x)}$
if the limit on the right side exists
