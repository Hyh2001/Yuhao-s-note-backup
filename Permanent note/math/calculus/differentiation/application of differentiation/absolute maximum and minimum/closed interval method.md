This method is the utility of [[extreme value theorem]]. The method applies to closed-interval functions. The steps are as follow: 
1. Find the values of $f$ at the [[critical number]]s of $f$ in $[a,b]$.
2. Find the values of $f$ at the endpoints of the interval.
3. The largest of the values from Steps $1$ and $2$ is the[[ absolute maximum]] value; the smallest of these values is the [[absolute minimum]] value.
