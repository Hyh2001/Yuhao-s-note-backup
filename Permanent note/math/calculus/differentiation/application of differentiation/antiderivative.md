#calculus/differentiation 
A function $F$ is called an antiderivative of $f$ on an interval $I$ if $F^{'}(x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in $I$

# general antiderivative

If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on an interval $I$, then the most general antiderivative of $f$ on $I$ is $F(x) + C$, $C$ is an arbitrary constant.
