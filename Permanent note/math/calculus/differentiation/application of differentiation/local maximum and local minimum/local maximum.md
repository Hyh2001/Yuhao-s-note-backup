The number $f(c)$is a
*local maximum* value of $f$ if $f(c) \geq f(x)$ when $x$ is near $c$

## precise definition

If $f^{'}$ changes from positive to negative at $c$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$

#### second derivative test

Suppose $f^{''}$ is continuous near $c$
If $f^{'}(c) = 0$ and $f^{''}(c) &gt; 0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$
