# principle

Zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we noticed that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line

# method

we use the tangent line at $(a,f(a))$ as an approximation to the curve $y = f(x)$when x is near $a$

## tangent line

$y \simeq f(a) + f^{'}(a)(x-a)$
also see [[derivative]]

### property

==This formula is true only when $x$ is near $a$  ==
