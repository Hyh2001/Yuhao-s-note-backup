proof:
1. we show that every sequence has a [[monotone]] subsequence. 
2. Every Cauchy sequence is [[bounded]] which means that every subsequence also. 
3. The above two means that the subsequence is bounded and monotone which means that it converges. 
4. We can proof that the Cauchy sequence converges to the same [[limit]] as the subsequence.
