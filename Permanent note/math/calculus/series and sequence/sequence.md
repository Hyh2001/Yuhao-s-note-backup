A sequence can be thought as a list of numbers written in a definite order.
$a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$ and it can be denoted as $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$, $a_1$ is called the first term, $a_2$ is called the second term and $a_n$ is called the $n-th$ term. <span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FYL3VT4CZ%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%224AJYG6SX%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A32%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B125.281%2C352.948%2C280.214%2C362.074%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FT6IUTL24%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D" ztype="zhighlight"><a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YL3VT4CZ?page=33&#x26;annotation=4AJYG6SX">“sequence”</a></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FT6IUTL24%22%5D%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FT6IUTL24%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22book%22%2C%22collection-title%22%3A%22Undergraduate%20Texts%20in%20Mathematics%22%2C%22event-place%22%3A%22New%20York%2C%20NY%22%2C%22ISBN%22%3A%22978-1-4614-7945-1%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22DOI%3A%2010.1007%2F978-1-4614-7946-8%22%2C%22publisher%22%3A%22Springer%20New%20York%22%2C%22publisher-place%22%3A%22New%20York%2C%20NY%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22DOI.org%20(Crossref)%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Calculus%20With%20Applications%22%2C%22URL%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2F10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7946-8%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Lax%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Peter%20D.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Terrell%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Maria%20Shea%22%7D%5D%2C%22accessed%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222022%22%2C12%2C19%5D%5D%7D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222014%22%5D%5D%7D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/T6IUTL24">Lax 和 Terrell, 2014</a></span>)</span> 
# limit of a sequence 
We say that an infinite sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n,  \ldots$ converges to the number $a$ (is convergent) if given any [[tolerance]] $ε > 0$, no matter how small, there is a whole number $N$, dependent on $ε$, such that for all $n > N$, an differs from a by less than $ε$:
$\left|a_n-a\right|<\varepsilon$
The number a is called the limit of the sequence {an}, and we write: 
$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n=a$

## arithmetic of limit of a sequence 
(a) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(a_n+b_n\right)=a+b$ .

(b) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(a_n b_n\right)=a b$ .

(c) If a is not zero, then for \$n\$ large enough, $a_n \neq 0$ , and $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{a_n}=\frac{1}{a}$
