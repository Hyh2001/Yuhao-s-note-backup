If $I_1,I_2,I_3,…$ is a sequence of [[nested interval]] . Then the intervals $I_n$ have at least one point in common. If  the lengths of the intervals tend to $0$, there is exactly one point in common.

**Proof**
Denote by $a_n$ and $b_n$ the left and right endpoints of $I_n$. The assumption of nesting means that the sequence ${a_n}$ increases, the sequence ${b_n}$ decreases, and that each $b_n$ is greater than every $a_n$. So by the [[monotone convergence theorem]], ${a_n}$ converges to some limit $a$, and ${b_n}$ to some limit $b$. By the way we constructed the limits, we know that $a_n ≤ a$ and $b ≤ b_n$. Now, $a$  cannot be greater than $b$, for otherwise, some $a_n$ would be larger than some $b_m$, violating the nesting assumption. So $a$ must be less than or equal to $b$, and $a_n ≤ a ≤ b ≤ b_n$. If the lengths of the intervals $I_n$ tend to zero as $n$ tends to infinity, then the distance between $a$ and $b$ must be zero, and the intervals In have exactly one point in common, namely the point $a = b$. If the lengths of the $I_n$ do not tend to zero, then $[a, b]$ belongs to all the intervals $I_n$, and the intervals have many points in common.
