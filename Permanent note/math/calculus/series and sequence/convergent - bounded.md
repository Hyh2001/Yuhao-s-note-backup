The relationship between [[convergent]] and [[bounded]] is that: 
1. every convergent sequence is bounded. 
2. An increasing sequence that is bounded converges to a limit. 

## proof 
1. proof in Pro.1.35
2. Proceeding in this manner, we see that there is a number $N(k)$ such that for $n$ greater than $N(k)$, the integer part and the first $k$ digits of $a_n$ are equal. Let us denote these common digits by $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$, and denote by $a$ the number whose integer part is $w$ and whose $k$th digit is $c_k$ for all $k$ . Then for $n$ greater than $N(k), a_n$ differs from $a$ by less than $10^{-k}$ ; this proves that the sequence $\left\{a_n\right\}$  converges to $a$ . Also, a decreasing sequence that is bounded converges to a limit. The proof is by defining its negative.
