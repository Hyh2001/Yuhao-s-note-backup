# calculation laws of inequality 
1. trichotomy: For any numbers $a$ and $b$, either $a<b$, $a=b$, $a>b$
2. transitivity: If $a<b$ and $b<c$, then $a<c$. 
3. addition: If $a<b$ and $c<d$, then $a+c<b+c$ and $a+c<b+d$ 
4. multiplication: If $a<b$ and $p$ is positive, then $pa<pb$, but if $a<b$ and $n$ is negative, then $nb < na$ 
5. reciprocal: If $a$ and $b$ are positive numbers and $a<b$, then $\frac{1}{b}<\frac{1}{a}$ 
With the exception of trichotomy, these rules are still true if $<$ is replaced by $\leq$ 
# special inequalities 
1. [[triangular inequality]]
2. [[arithmetic-geometric mean inequality]]
# applications of inequalities 
1. Inequalities can be used to prove the equality of two numbers by showing that one is neither less than nor greater than the other.
2. Inequality can be used to determine a number by trapping it within progressively tighter intervals.
