There are two ways to view a number. 
1. as a infinite decimals
2. as points on a number line 
To determine a number, we must be able to give an approximation to number $a$ for any [[tolerance]] $\epsilon$, no matter how small. <span class="highlight" data-annotation="%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FYL3VT4CZ%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22NICABGDK%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A23%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.88%2C102.628%2C385.686%2C111.754%5D%2C%5B53.88%2C90.628%2C121.203%2C99.754%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FT6IUTL24%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D" ztype="zhighlight"><a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YL3VT4CZ?page=24&#x26;annotation=NICABGDK">“number”</a></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FT6IUTL24%22%5D%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9667514%2Fitems%2FT6IUTL24%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22book%22%2C%22collection-title%22%3A%22Undergraduate%20Texts%20in%20Mathematics%22%2C%22event-place%22%3A%22New%20York%2C%20NY%22%2C%22ISBN%22%3A%22978-1-4614-7945-1%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22DOI%3A%2010.1007%2F978-1-4614-7946-8%22%2C%22publisher%22%3A%22Springer%20New%20York%22%2C%22publisher-place%22%3A%22New%20York%2C%20NY%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22DOI.org%20(Crossref)%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Calculus%20With%20Applications%22%2C%22URL%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2F10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7946-8%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Lax%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Peter%20D.%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Terrell%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Maria%20Shea%22%7D%5D%2C%22accessed%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222022%22%2C12%2C19%5D%5D%7D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222014%22%5D%5D%7D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/T6IUTL24">Lax 和 Terrell, 2014</a></span>)</span>
# representing numbers as infinite decimals 
We can divide an interval into infinitely many intervals with nonoverlapping by including the left point of each interval and exclude the right one. Therefore we can find each number belongs to one of the interval $n \leq a < n+1$. For decimals, we can repeat the process mentioned above and we can get $n + \frac{\alpha_1}{10} \leq n + \frac{\alpha_1+1}{10}$. By repeating the procedure, we can find the decimal representation of a number.
