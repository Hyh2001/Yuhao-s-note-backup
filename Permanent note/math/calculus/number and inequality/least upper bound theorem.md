#calculus 
Every set S of numbers that is bounded above has a [[least upper bound]].
proof:
1.  compare all the numbers inside the set digit by digit and finally we can get the largest one a
2.  This number is the smallest upper bound because if we choose arbitrary digit to be less than that in a, then there will be a number in set a larger than it.
