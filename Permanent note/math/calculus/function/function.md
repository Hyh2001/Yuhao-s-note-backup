#calculus/function #review 

A function assigns an element $x$ of one set, called the [[domain]], to an element $f(x)$ (this element is called the value of $f$ at $x$) of another set, called the [[codomain]]. The pair $(x, f (x))$ is called a [[graph]] of function $f$.  ($f: A \to B$) A function from one variable to one variable is called a scalar function and a function from one variable to more than one variable is called a vector function.   
$x \in R^D$ to $f(x) \in E$

In-depth understanding: 
$f$ is a [[mapping]] from $R^D$ to $R$ Which assigns every input $x$ exactly one function value $f(x)$.

## determination of whether it is a function
A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. 
## [[representation of a function]]
# properties of functions 
## [[bounded function]] 
## [[root]]
### [[fixed point]]
# real word understanding of a function
1. A move that measures a variable from a sample.
