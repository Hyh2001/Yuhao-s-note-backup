# event

The definition of an event in a discrete sample space[^1] $S$ is a collection of  simple event[^2]s. ( Event is any subset of $S$ ). It is denoted as $A$. 

# types of events

There are several types of events. They are as follow:

## simple event[^2]

## compound event[^3]

## random event[^4]

a set of basic outcomes from the sample space, and it is said to occur if the random experiment gives rise to one of the basic outcomes.

## complementary event[^5]

If $E$ is any event in the sample space, $E ^{'}$ is the event “E does not occur”, then $E ^{'}$ is the complementary event of $E$

## independent event[^6]

# relationships of events
