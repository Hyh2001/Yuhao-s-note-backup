The probability of the union of two events $A$ and $B$ is
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, $P(A \cap B) = 0$ and
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

## theorem

$P(A) = 1 - P(\bar{A})$

### proof

$S = A \cup \bar{A}$. Thus $P( A \cup \bar{A}) = P(S) = 1$
For $A$ and $\bar{A}$ are exclusive, then $P(A \cup \bar{A}) = P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1$
