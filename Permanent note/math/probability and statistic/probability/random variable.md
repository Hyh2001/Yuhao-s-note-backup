Random variable is a real-valued function defined on the sample space. It maps an event to a real valued number $\mathbb{R}$. 

### understanding of random variables

We can understand random variable in this way. Taking an experiment as an example. The process we observe the value of a sample is a *random variable*, the number we measured is the *numerical value*.

## why we need random variables?

Sometimes our interest is mainly in some function of the outcomes rather than the outcome itself, thus we can use random variable to denote the function.

## types of random variables

There are two types of random variables, the first is [[discrete random variable]] and the second is [[Continuous random variable]]. Also we can have random variable consists of multiple random varaibles and it is denoted as  [[joint distribution random variable]]

## properties of random variables

We use [[expected value]] and [[variance]] to assess a random distribution. (They are both [[moment]] s 

# function of random varaibles

If we are given a random variable $X$ and its probability density function, and we want to know the probability density function of $Y$ which a function of $X$, we can use the method below: 

1. [[moment-generating function]]
2. [[transformation of random variable]]
