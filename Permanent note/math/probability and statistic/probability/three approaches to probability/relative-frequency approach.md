# relative-frequency approach

Let $A$ be an event of interest, and assume that you have performed the same experiment $n$ times so that $n$ is the number of times $A$ could have occurred. Further, let $n_A$ be the number of times that $A$ did occur, then $P(A) = lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n_A}{n}$. ==This approach is viewed as an attempt. ==
