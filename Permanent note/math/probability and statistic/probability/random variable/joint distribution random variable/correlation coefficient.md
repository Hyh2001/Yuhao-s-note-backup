Correlation coefficient is defined for solving the problem that value of covariance[^1] can not directly measure the dependencies of [[random variable]]s. $^{[1]}$ It is defined as $\rho = \frac{Cov(Y_1,Y_2)}{\sigma_1\sigma_2}$.  $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$  are the [[standard deviation]] of random variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$.

# measure dependencies

If $\rho =1$, the two values are linearly dependent.  
If $\rho = 0$, the two values are linearly independent.

#todo#​what if $\rho$ is between $0 - 1$?
