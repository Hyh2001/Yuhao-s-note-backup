#probability/joint_distribution_random_variable 

We define it as: let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be discrete random variables. The joint probability function for $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ is as 

$p(y_1,y_2) = P(Y_1 = y_1, Y_2 = y_2)$ with $-\infty < y_1, y_2 < \infty$ 

It is just the same of the probability of the intersection of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$: $P(Y_1 \cap Y_2)$
