# joint density function

We define it as: if $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are jointly continuous random variables with a joint desity function given by $f(y_1,y_2)$, then 

1. $$
    f(y_1,y_2) \geq 0 \quad for \quad all \quad  y_1,y_2
    $$
2. $$
    \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(y_1,y_2)dy_1dy_2 = 1
    $$

It is just the same of the probability of the intersection of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$: $P(Y_1 \cap Y_2)$
