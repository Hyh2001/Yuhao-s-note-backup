#probability 

We define the moment of a random variable on $\mathbb{R}$  as $E[X^r]$ (and it is called the $r^{th}$ moment of $X$) where $E[\quad]$ denotes expected value.

## why we define moment? 
#todo 

# centered moment

We define the centered moment of a random variable as $E[(X-E[X])^r]$ 

# properties

[[expected value]] is the first moment and [[variance]] is the second centered moment.$^{2}$
