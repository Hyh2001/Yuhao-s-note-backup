For two random variables no matter discrete or continuous  joint cumulative distribution functions (In $^{[2]}$, it is also named as joint distribution functions) can be define  as $F(x,y) = P(X \leq x,Y \leq y) -\infty < x,y < \infty$ $P$ is the joint distribution.  
$\leq$ means that we also need to consider boundary points which may affect discrete types. There are several properties of joint cumulative distribution functions.

1. $P(x_1 < X \leq x_2,y_1 < Y \leq y_2) = F(x_2,y_2) - F(x_2,y_1) - F(x_1,y_2) + F(x_1,y_1)$   proof: #todo
