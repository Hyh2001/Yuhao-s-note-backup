#probability 
Let X and Y be two random variables, discrete or continuous, with joint probability distribution $f (x, y)$ and marginal distribution $g(x)$ and $h(y)$, respectively. The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are said to be statistically independent if and only if  
â€‹$f(x,y) = g(x) \cdot h(y)$  
for all $(x,y)$ in the range.

# indepedent and statistically intendent

It is the same for us to say two random variables are [[independent]] or statistically independent
