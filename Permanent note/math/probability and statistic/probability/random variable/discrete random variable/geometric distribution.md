# geometric distribution

​#probability/discrete random variable#​

Geometric distribution is a distribution that has a probability mass function as follow.
$P(x = n) = (1-p)^{n-1}p$, $p$ is the probability of success. Its [[expected value]] and [[variance]] are as follow.

# [[expected value]] of Geometric distribution

$u = \frac{1}{p}$

# [[variance]]  of Geometric distribution

$V(x) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$
