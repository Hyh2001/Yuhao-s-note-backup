#probability/discrete_random_variable

A random variable that can take on at most a countable number of possible values us said to be discrete and this type of random variable is called discrete random variable. For a discrete random variable $X$, we define the *probability mass function* $p(a)$ Of $X$ as
$p(a) = P\{X=a\}$
There are several types of discrete random variables. They are as follow.
