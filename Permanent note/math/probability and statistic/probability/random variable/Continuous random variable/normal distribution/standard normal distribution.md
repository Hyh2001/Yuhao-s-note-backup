#probability/continuous_random_variable 

For $X$ is normally distributed (see [[normal distribution]]) with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, then $Z = (X - \mu)/\sigma$ is normally distributed with parameters 0 and 1. Also, 0 is the expected value of this distribution and 1 is the variance of this distribution.

 There are two types of problems relevant to standard normal distribution:

1. The first type is about given $x$ to find probability
2. and the other type is about given probability and find $x$.

# excel

## Problem 1

We can use the excel function

```excel
NORM.S.DIST(z,cumulative)
```

## Problem 2

We can use excel function

```excel
NORM.INV (probability, Mean, standard_dev)
```
