# Weibull distribution 

The probability density functon of this distribution is $f(x) = \begin{array}{lcl} \alpha\beta x^{\beta-1}e^{-\alpha x^{\beta}} & x>0 \\ 0 & elsewhere\end{array}$

The expected value of this distribution is $\mu = \alpha^{\frac{1}{\beta}}\gamma(1+\frac{1}{\beta})$and $\sigma^2 = \alpha^{-\frac{2}{\beta}}\{\gamma(1+\frac{2}{\beta} - [\gamma(1+\frac{1}{\beta}]^2\}$

Its cumulative functio is $F = 1- e^{-\alpha x^{\beta}}$, $x \geq 0$
