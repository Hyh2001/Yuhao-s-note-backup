# expected value of a discrete random variable

If $X$ is a discrete random variable having a probability mass function $p(x)$, then the *expected value ​*of $X$, denoted by $E[X]$, is defined by  
$E[X] = \sum_{x:p(x) > 0} xp(x)$

# expected value of a Continuous random variable

The expected value of a continuous random variable $Y$ is defined as:$^{[2]}$

$E(Y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf(y)dy$    where $f(y)$ is the probability density function of  $Y$

# expected value of a function of a random variable

1. $E[aX + b ] = aE[x] + b$
2.  $E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$
3. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, then $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$
