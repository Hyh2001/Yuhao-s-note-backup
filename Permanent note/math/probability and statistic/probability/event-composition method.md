# event-composition method

​#probability#​

This method is used to calculate probability[^1]. We can expresses event[^2] $A$ as a composition involving unions and/or intersections of other events. The laws of probability are then applied to find $P(A)$.

# steps

1. Define the experiment.
2. Visualize the nature of the sample points. Identify a few to clarify your thinking.
3. Write an equation expressing the event of interest—say, $A$—as a composition of two or more events, using unions, intersections, and/or complements. (Notice that this equates point sets.) Make certain that event $A$ and the event implied by the composition represent the same set of sample points.  we should choose the events whose probability are already known by us.
4. Apply the additive and multiplicative laws of probability to the compositions obtained in step 3 to find $P(A)$.

[^2]: # event

    The definition of an event in a discrete sample space[^3] $S$ is a collection of  simple event[^4]s. ( Event is any subset of $S$ ). It is denoted as $A$. 

    # types of events

    There are several types of events. They are as follow:

    ## simple event[^4]

    ## compound event[^5]

    ## random event[^6]

    a set of basic outcomes from the sample space, and it is said to occur if the random experiment gives rise to one of the basic outcomes.

    ## complementary event[^7]

    If $E$ is any event in the sample space, $E ^{'}$ is the event “E does not occur”, then $E ^{'}$ is the complementary event of $E$

    ## independent event[^8]

    # relationships of events


[^3]: # sample space

    A sample space is the set that contains all the outcomes of an [[experiment]] . It consists of all possible [[simple event |sample point]]s.

    ## denoting

    $S$

    ## discrete sample space

    One that contains either a finite or a countable number of distinct sample point


[^4]: # simple event

    # definition

    An event that cannot be decomposed. They only correspond to one and only one *sample point*.

    ## denoting

    The letter $E$ with a subscript will be used


[^5]: # compound event

    ‍


[^6]: # random event

    ‍


[^7]: # complementary event

    Mutually exclusive events are the events that do not occur at the same time.

    ‍


[^8]: # independent event

    Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be *independent* if any one of the following holds:
    $P(A|B) = P(A)$
    $P(B|A) = P(B)$
    $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$
