#probability

Probability is a measure of one's belief in the occurrence of a future event. A science of identifying essential patterns that occur in random [[event]]s. We define it as follow.  To every [[event]]  $A$ in $S$([[sample space]]) ($A$ is a [[subset]] of $S$) , we assign a number, $P(A)$, the *probability* of $A$. There are three approaches to view a probability. They are as follow:

## three approaches (understand of probability)

There are three approaches to probability and they are as follow:

1. [[classical approach]]
2. [[relative-frequency approach]]
3. [[subjective approach]]

## axioms of probability

There are several properties of  this assigned number $P(A)$, they are called *axioms of probability*. They are as follow:  
[[axioms of probability]]

## calculation law of probability

Based on the axiom above, some [[proposition]]s can be proposed:

1. For mutually complementary event $P(S) = P(E \cup E^{'}) = 1$
2. To calculate the sum of two events, we can have [[additive law of probability]].
3. To calculate the intersect of two events, we can have [[multiplicative law of probability]]
   To calculate the probability of a single event, there are two methods:
4. [[event-composition method]]
5. [[sample-point method]]

## [[conditional probability]]

There is type of probability which is the probability of an event based on the occurrence of another event. (See conditional probability )

## [[Bayes‘ rule]] 

We can use Bayes' rule to divide an event into several parts which are its intersection with other events.

## [[random variable]]

Random variable is a powerful tool. We can use it to represent more events which are the function of several outcomes.
