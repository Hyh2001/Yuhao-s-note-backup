From two given sets A and B, we can form a new set called the union of A and B. It is defined as the set of those elements which are in A, in B, or in both. 
we can denote the set as
$C = A \cup B$ 
the strict definition is: 
$x \in A \cup B$  IFF $x \in A$  OR  $x \in B$

1. commutative:
$A \cup B = B \cup A$ 
2. associative
$(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$
