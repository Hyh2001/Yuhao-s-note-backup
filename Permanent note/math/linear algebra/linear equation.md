#linear_algebra 

They are equations with only order-one terms and constants. They are in the form of 
$x_1u + x_2v + x_3w ... = b$ 
They can have a unique solution, no solution or an infinity of solutions of $\vec{x}$ . 

1. If we try to solve equations with no solution then we will finally get an ***inconsistent*** equation.
2. If we try to solve equations with infinity of solutions, then we will certainly get some free parameters whose value can be randomly chosen
