# eigenvectors

The vectors that let $Ax$ and $x$ points to the same direction

## math model

$Ax = \lambda x$ $\lambda$ is a multiple of $x$

## properties

1.Add $nI$ to $A$ will not change its eigenvectors
2.For triangular matrix, eigenvectors are [[linear dependent]] and they don’t have n independent eigenvectors
3.eigenvectors of $A^2$ equals to $A$
