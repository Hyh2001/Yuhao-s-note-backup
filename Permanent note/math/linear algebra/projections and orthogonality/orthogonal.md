* [ ] 拆分 orthogonal 
For two vectors, if they are orthogonal, it means that :: $x^Ty = 0$

## properties

1. $||x||^2 + ||y||^2 = |||x + y||^2$
2. $0$ vector is **orthogonal to** every vectors

## orthogonality for subspaces

[[subspace]] $S$ is orthogonal to subspace $T$, if every vector in $S$ is orthogonal to every vector in $T$

### consider four subspaces

1. [[Row space]] is orthogonal to [[nullspace]]:  
   Prove:  For $Ax = 0$ each row of $A$ times $x$ equals $0$ which means they are orthogonal to each other
2. [[column space]]  is orthogonal to [[left nullspace]]:  
   Prove: For $A^Ty = 0$ each rows of $A^T$ are columns of $A$  And they are orthogonal to $y$ .

## [[orthogonal complement]]
