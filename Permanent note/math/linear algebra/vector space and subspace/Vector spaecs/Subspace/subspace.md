A set of vectors that satisfies two requirements that for two vectors $v$ and $w$ ,  $v+w$ and $cv$ are still in the sub space. ($c$ is a scalar)

## properties

1. Every sub space contains zero vector.
2. Contains all the linear combinations of $v$ and $w$

## dimension of a subspace

The number of vectors in any [[Basis]] is the dimension of the space.

## four subspaces

### properties

1. Dimension of four subspaces ([[Nullspace]],[[Left nullspace]],[[column space]],[[row space]]) $C(A) = C(A^T) = r$ $N(A) = n-r,N(A^T)=m-r$

## applications

1. Bases for matrix spaces and function spaces
