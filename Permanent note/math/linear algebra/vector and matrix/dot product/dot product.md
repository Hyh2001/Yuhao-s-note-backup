Dot product is denoted as $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$ where $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |a||b|cos\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. Also dot product can be calculated via  $U \cdot V = u_1v_1+u_2v_2+\ldots+u_nv_n$.  From the two denotations ways above, we can see that dot product is independent of coordinate systems. 
we can proof this by using the formula $(||U|| - ||V||)^2 = ||U||^2 + ||V||^2 -2U \cdot V$, we can see that for norms they are coordinate system independent and therefore $2U \cdot V$ must be independent too.


## properties of dot product

1. Dot product is $0$ if two vectors are [[perpendicular]] to each other.
2. Dot product is commutative

    $\vec{s} \cdot \vec{r} = \vec{r} \cdot \vec{s}$

## dot products for finding angles between two vectors

$u \cdot v /||u||||v||= cos \theta$  

## [[dot product - norm]] 

### properties

$|v \cdot w| \leq ||v||||w||$  
​$||v + w|| \leq ||v|| + ||w||$
