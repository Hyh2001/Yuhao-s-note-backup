#linear_algebra 
Forward substitution is the method that when we have solved $x_1$, we take its value forward to the next equation where we solve for $x_2$, and once we have solved for $x_1$ and $x_2$, we take their values forward to the next equation where we solve for $x_3$. Finally we can solve for $x_n$. It is the method used to solve [[lower-triangular matrix]] type problems. 
# When this method fail? 
If the [[diagonal]] of the matrix corresponding to the system of linear equations has a zero on it, then this method fails.
