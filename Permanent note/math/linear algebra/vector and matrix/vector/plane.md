#calculus

A plane containing the origin is uniquely determined by ***linear combination***s of two vectors, call them $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{s}$. We also say that $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{s}$ ***span*** the plane. $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{s}$ are **not unique**. 

$\{u\vec{s} + v\vec{r} | u,v \in \mathbb{R}\}$ where each point in the plane corresponds to a pair of $(u,v)$

# plane that does not passing through the origin

It can be represented by adding a vector $\vec{a}$ to a plane passing through the origin.

$\{\vec{a} + u\vec{s} + v\vec{r} | u,v \in \mathbb{R}\}$
