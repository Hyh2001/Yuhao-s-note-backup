It is a [[vector]] with two numbers in an ordered pair. We denote a vector by a capital letter

$\mathbf{U}=\left(u_1, u_2\right)$

The numbers $u_1$ and $u_2$  are called the components of the vector $\mathbf{U}$ . The set of all two-dimensional vectors, denoted $\mathbb{R}^2$, is called two-dimensional space.
