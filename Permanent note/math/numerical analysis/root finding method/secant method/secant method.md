The secant method replaces the $f^{'}(x_{k})$ of [[Newton's method]] with :: $\frac{f (x_{k})-f(x_{k-1})}{x_{k}-x_{k-1}}$ 
and we can get **$x_{k+1} = x_{k}-\frac{f(x_{k})}{f(x_{k})-f(x_{k-1})}(x_{k}-x_{k-1})$** 
Since the method involves both $x_{k}$ and $x_{k-1}$, it is called a **two-step** method. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3UESHXG?page=77&annotation=BKHCD8KC))
# [[order of convergence]]
Convergence order of the method is :: $p = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$
