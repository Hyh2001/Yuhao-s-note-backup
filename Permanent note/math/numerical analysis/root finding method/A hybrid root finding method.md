This method has combined the [[bisection method]] with [[Newton's secant method]] or [[secant method]] and it tries to give a [[global convergence]]. 
We can use the [[iterative method]] below to solve root finding problems: 
1. start with a rough guess $[x_0,x_1]$ 
2. apply Newton's secant method or secant method. If converges then stop 
3. If diverges then we apply a few iteration of bisection method 
4. go back to 2 and repeat the process
