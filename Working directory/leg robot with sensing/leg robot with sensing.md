1. We can try to use the signal of internal sensors like sensors for measuring joint angles and angular speeds to train a model. The method in [ .. ] can be referenced. (The problem is that this method is quite hard and noise signals will make great influences)


1. Design a new type of tactile sensors for classification (Actually piezoelectric and electrostatic sensors belong to tactile sensors )
2. I wish to build a real-time online classification system based on Cassie and open source the data as a baseline
3. try out different classifiers and feature extraction methods.
