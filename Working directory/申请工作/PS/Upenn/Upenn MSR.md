## Nanorobotics

This course will provide me with the required knowlege working on soft nano robots control and planning which is really interesting for me. 

## Control and Optimization with Applications in Robotics

This course will facilaite my understanding on how to control various robots like soft robots, legged robtos and medical robots. Its content is vital for my research

# Professor

## Cynthia Sung

I am interested in working with Prof. Sung on two projects. The first porject is about building compliant robots with soft sensors. I am interested in attaching soft sensors to compliant robots and buidling controllers based on the feedback of the sensors. The second project is about the foldable robots. I am interested in investigating on its dynamic behaviours and specifically designing control and planning algorithms for it. 

## Michael Posa

Prof. Posa's reasearch interests well accord my interest in finding out what types of mechanical structures are sutiable for using data-driven methods to control. 

## Marc Miskin

I am really interested in the cell-scale robot built by Prof. Miskin. Working on the control and planning problems of this robot to accomplish some complex tasks is really what I am chasing for in the filed of nanorobotics.
