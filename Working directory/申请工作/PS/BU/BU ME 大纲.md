# interested courses

## medical robotics

This course will facilitate my understanding of medical robotics. I want to learn to specifically design soft sensors to facilitate their using on medical robots

## Nonlinear Systems & Control

This course will give me the required knowledge on modelling and controlling soft materials and thus build tools that need more accurate performance with them.

# Prof. Catherine M.klapperich

# Prof.  Sean B. Andersson

# Prof. Andrew Sabelhus

Working with Prof. Andrew Sabelhus on problems:

1. Working on how to precisely control soft robots to integrate them into unstructured environment
2. Working on developing artificial intelligence for soft robots
