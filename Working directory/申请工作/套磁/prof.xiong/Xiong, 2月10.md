Dear Prof. Xiong,
  Thank you for your quick reply and I am now working on the quick literature review on leg design with sensing. I have already had some ideas and after a more careful review, I will try to share them with you in a more structured manner. 
  Considering the goal of my research, I think that it is why I am quite interested in the project about leg robot with sensing. Before I started to specifically read the materials about bipedal robotics, I have already heard about the hard problem: how to perform robot manipulations in unstructured environments. This type of problems have fulfilled my interests in both building a solid theoretical background and working on something meaningful to the robotics community. Going back to bipedal robotics, after some reading I think that the problem of how robots perform bipedal locomotion in rough terrains is exactly the one I am interested in.  The leg design and sensing problem will be a good entry point for it because sensing the terrain may be a prerequisite for a robot to walk on it.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I agree with your opinion that a goal will make things clearer. During our interview I have introduced that my long term goal is to build some real world products or techniques that can both fulfill my interest and benifite the community. Starting from the beginning of our connections, I tried to read some blogs and papers to try to familiar myself with
